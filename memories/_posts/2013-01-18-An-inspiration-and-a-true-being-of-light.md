I never had a chance to meet Aaron, but have known him through his work. He is an inspiration and a true being of light. Reading what the others have wrote, I find that everything there is to say has already been said about him. He was one of the few amongst us 20-somethings that actually had substance. He was one of the few that is worthy of being looked up to. His light will shine on forever. He left us a legacy, and his name will never be forgotten.
