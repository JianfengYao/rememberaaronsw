A sad welcome to the club. Our daughter, Lauren, took her life 16 months ago.
 
I realize that the death of Aaron is so public and that the news media and Aaron’s followers will buoy you all up during the “shock” period.
 
I just wanted to reach out as another father who lost a child to this.
 
There is not much help out there for dads.
 
We need to get together and talk.
 
If you want to, I’m all ears. We raised the kids in Naperville, IL.
 
Doug Marlowe, father of Lauren Jill Marlowe 2/5/1984 – 9/20/2011.
