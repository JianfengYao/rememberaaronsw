Like so many of us, I have come to know of Aaron much too late.  It is beyond words to express how sad it is to loose such a formidable warrior.  It is also not difficult to figure out that he just knew too much and that he was already in danger before this.  But his passing is also a victory at the same time.  He has drawn attention of vast number of people around the world to key problems that we face as humanity.  I have learned so much from him in the last few days from his blogs and his talks.  He has shown us a path and I will go there as far as I can.  He is irreplaceable but a part of him will live on in all of us who really understand him.  Blessings and Peace Aaron!
