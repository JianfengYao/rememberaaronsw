The only thing that can reach eternity is an idea. Aaron gave us just that. 
Beyond greed, beyond power, beyond selfishness the quest of Aaron to protect the small and enable each of us to live Free is precisely the kind of idea that  is worth dying for. 


Aaron: 
I deeply regret that you will not be here to continue showing us the way. But we will try to deserve what you gave us, and continue your fight. Thank you for what you did for us.  

The world needs more people like you. We will continue your quest. For you, for your family, and because this idea of yours is worth dying for.
