One thing I am trying to do in Aaron’s memory is spread his Guerilla Open Access Manifesto as much as I can. Gratitude and admiration are both not strong enough to describe what I feel for Aaron’s work. I wish a candle could hold all those feelings and carry them upwards to feel their warmth where he is now. Thank you Aaron. Rest in peace. We will try to continue the information war.
