To the parents and family of Aaron Swartz--
 
Although I didn't know Aaron personally,  I feel like "we are all" Aaron Swartz.
I am taking this opportunity to express my heartfelt condolences to his loving
family and condemn the actions of our over-zealous government in prosecuting/bullying the wrong people.
We know Aaron's death will not be in vain, and that justice WILL BE SERVED in bringing those
who abused the system to pay for their hideous and inhumane actions.
