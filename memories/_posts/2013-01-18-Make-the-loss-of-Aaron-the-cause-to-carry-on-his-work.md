I am so sorry about the tragic loss of Aaron. Although I never met him
but I admire and appreciate the great work he had accomplished. Like
many, I will remember his tireless selfless and astonishing effort to
advance democracy.  Like many, I will work to cherish that memory.
Though we can’t bring him back, we will make sure he didn’t die in
vein by carry on his work. Thank you for giving us such a brilliant
humanitarian.
RIP, Aaron.
