I did not know of Aaron before I heard of his death and as many others I suspect I researched him, I wanted to know of his values and his accomplishments. Learning what I have I feel that he truly had an amazing gift, a unwavering moral compass and a true belief in what he stood for and for that I admire him. To his family as I said I never knew him but people all around the world are screaming for justice and learning about your amazingly talented son.
