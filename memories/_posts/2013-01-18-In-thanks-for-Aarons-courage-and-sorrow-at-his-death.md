My son informed me of Aaron's suicide when we met for lunch this week.  I am appalled that our government engages in this destructive persecution of individuals who seek to keep the public informed of important information.  Is our country turning into a police state?  

I am so sorry, and give my deepest condolences to Aaron's family and friends.
