me to get science papers I cannot afford.  I am a self taught marine
person who has worked with many research projects, but am not
affiliated with any one institution.  Getting science papers is a
begging affair for me. I cannot afford a 35 dollar download to check a
protocol.  The very idea that someone would try to freeshare science
papers is the most freethinking educational idea I've ever heard of.
Thank you for unleashing the power of the idea.  I hope others with
better know how than I will continue with it.  You are a great loss to
me, and others ike me who could really have benefitted from what you
did. Peace to those close who knew you well. Meri
