I heard of Aaron Swartz only after his death. Shortly afterwards I found myself reading on his website. It didn't take long till I couldn't hold weeping. As I read more and more of his essays and saw all the things Aaron had achieved â€“ not for himself, but instead for the society as a whole I understood that Aaron was not only a very intelligent, but also a very idealistic young man with a great drive to make the world a better place.

I don't have an idea what comes after the end of life, but I'm convinced that if we had more selfless and empathic people like Aaron, heaven would be a place on earth.

My deepest condolences go out to his family. I hope you find the strength to cope with the loss of Aaron.
