I had not even heard his name until yesterday but have been strangely touched and have found myself weeping. It's very sad that someone so young felt so much darkness. We are living in dark times, and he may have done something wrong but the whole system is wrong. What stood out for me is his age. At 26 these charges would be a lot to handle and particularly if he was struggling with depression. I hope that his death is used for good and  that anyone who contributed towards it is held accountable.

I will keep his family, friends and loved ones in my prayers during this difficult time. I cannot imagine the heartbreak. God bless.
