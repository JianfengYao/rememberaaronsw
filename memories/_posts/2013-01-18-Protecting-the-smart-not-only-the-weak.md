This kid's tragic case underscores our nation's (academia, professionals, groups) inability to protect one of our brightest from destructive beauraucratic interventions. The lack of transparency and artificial locks he was fighting against ultimately destroyed him. What a shame and what a sham "investigation", an actual witch hunt.
My heart weeps especially for his family
God rest his soul
