Aaron and Family, your efforts have not been in vain.  Burned out, facing tons of legal crap, depressed, hating what has become of IT (my career for 20 plus years) in the Microsoft-SOPA-jackboot era - this week I got back to coding, logged on the EFF and am determined to rebuild my career as coder and activist.  Aaron, your picture is on my desktop, you are a modern Prometheus.  Knowledge is a far greater a gift to humans than fire, knowledge is our only hope in the quest for justice for the common man.  Sad that it takes such a tragedy for us to stop and think how extraordinary this explosion in access to knowledge has been via the Web, networks and computers in general, you fought for such a worthy cause.  Go with God Aaron, I won't forget you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
