More than a genious, more than a computer geek, more than all, you, Aaron, was a beautiful human being, a lovely soul, a person dedicated to distibute knowledge to all people, to improve this world. RIP, Aaron. This world does not  deserve you. The Justice of your country - of all countries - are made for the big-money guys,  not for the ones that desires that any person have rights to have dignity in their lifes , to learn, to grow. Your death is another proof that the human race is a failure and the exceptions - you was a enromous exception -  for that shall return to the cosmos, as bright energy, to work in another planets where love is the only law and inhabitants do not know what money means.
