In my circles, I know more than a few people who have stood up for what they believed in, taking a risk of serious consequences.  But most of them have been very strong, more outgoing personalities, who could react to attacks without flinching.  It is perhaps more brave to take on the world when you are shy and it can hurt you so badly.

I never quite knew what to make of Aaron.  Having been a whiz-kid myself I will admit I had some jealousy for somebody who was outdoing us all in that dept.  People don't realise just how hard it is to get adults to respect you and listen to you when you're that young.  He did it.

Aaron once said that I was one of his heroes.  All I can say is that kid, you got that backwards.  You're one of mine.
