...following the roads your long hard stepping to freedom of net, to freedom of mankind had beaten further ahead. 
i promise by heart to contribute all i'm able to do here in the material and here in the virtual dimension of this world - and not least to hold on to the memory of beings like you, aaron. we are the ones, aaron - not them! 
Thinking of you
