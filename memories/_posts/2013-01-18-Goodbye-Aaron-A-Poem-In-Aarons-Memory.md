As Tim Berners-Lee said: We have lost one of our own. 
It's tragic, it's sad. I know I don't need to explain, we all feel the same.

I wrote this poem in Aaron's memory and I would like to share it:

Goodbye Aaron:

That night the stars were less brighter.
That night was dark and silent...
like it was holding it's breath.
The sky didn't wanted to see.
The sun didn't wanted to come out.
A mother cried that morning.
A mother is still crying right now.
And innumerable souls
are still weeping in silence,
for you,
Aaron.
